# nbgitpuller Link Generator WebExtension

A browser extension to help you generate [nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/)
links directly from GitHub.

[Install Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nbgitpuller-link-generator/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)

## What does this do?

It adds an icon to the browser toolbar which will be enabled whenever you are on GitHub.

On clicking the button, a form pops up. You can enter a JupyterHub URL and the application
you want to use to open this file, folder or repository. Then you
can just copy the nbgitpuller URL, and share it with your students!

The JupyterHub URL and application you choose are remembered, so
you do not need to enter it over and over again.

## Building the webextension

```bash
npm install
npx webpack --mode=production
```

Then build for either browser: (They have slightly different manifest files)

```
npx web-ext build -s dist-firefox/ -a web-ext-artifacts-firefox --overwrite-dest
npx web-ext build -s dist-chrome/ -a web-ext-artifacts-chrome --overwrite-dest
```

This produces a `.zip` file in each `web-ext-artifacts*` folder that you can use.
